# Stock-Price-Prediction
This project predicts "Tesla stock price movements (2010-2017)" using "Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost". Feature engineering and StandardScaler were applied for better accuracy. Logistic Regression performed best, while XGBoost overfitted. Future work includes more data and LSTMs for improvedÂ predictions.

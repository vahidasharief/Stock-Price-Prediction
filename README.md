1. Stock Price Prediction

Stock price prediction is one of the most challenging tasks in finance. Machine learning (ML) can automate this process by analyzing historical data and predicting future trends. The primary goal of this project is to predict whether buying a particular stock will be profitable using various ML models.

2. Understanding the Problem Statement

Stock prices are influenced by multiple factors such as market trends, economic indicators, company performance, and investor sentiment. In this project, we aim to build an ML model that predicts stock movements based on historical price data. We will use the Tesla stock dataset, which includes OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data from January 2010 to December 2017.

3. Implementation

Importing Libraries

We will use the following Python libraries:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: Numerical computations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.

Scikit-learn: Data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

XGBoost: Gradient boosting algorithm for improved accuracy
